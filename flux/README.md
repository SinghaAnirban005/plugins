# Flux

The Flux plugin provides a way to visualize Flux (should be installed in your cluster) in Headlamp. Flux is a tool for implementing GitOps and synchronizing Kubernetes clusters with sources of configuration (like Git repositories). It also automates updates to configuration when there is new code to deploy.

This plugin adds a new item (Flux) to the sidebar to give the user an overview of the Flux installation on the cluster.

## Flux Installation

Please refer to the [official installation guide](https://fluxcd.io/flux/installation/) for Flux to learn to install it.
